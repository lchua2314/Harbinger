Harbinger

We created a video game using Python's Tkinter graphics library and Object-Oriented Programming. There is no outside sources or frameworks used in this project. All that is required is to have Python 3.7 installed and run each of the two Python files separately. The 'Harbinger_1_2.py' file is the normal mode while the 'Harbinger_Khaos.py' file is the more chaotic version of the game. The text document is a list of updates that we kept note of.
